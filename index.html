                <p>Before you can choose the right career, you must learn about yourself. Your values, interests, soft skills,
                    and aptitudes, in combination with your personality type, make some occupations a good fit for you and
                    others completely inappropriate. Use self-assessment tools, often called career tests, to gather information
                    about your traits and, subsequently generate a list of occupations that are a good fit based on them.
                    Some people choose to work with a career counselor or other career development professionals who can
                    help them navigate this process.</p>

                        want. It can also be scary when you do not know what it is that you want to do and when you are not
                        sure how you can make a living. The more you are in charge of your process, the better you will feel.
